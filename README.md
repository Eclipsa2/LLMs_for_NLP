- The used datasets are: **romania_dataset_solved.json** and **moldova_dataset_solved.json**
- Logistic regression results can be found in: **lr_results_content.json** and **lr_results_title.json**
- All experiments are grouped by model (xl or ro), training dataset (ro or md) and variation (01-04) in the **experiments** folder along with the training scripts, perplexity computing scripts, perplexity results, logistic regression scripts and zip archives of the LoRA adapters, tokenizers and last step saves while training.
- A **base** subfolder in the **experiments** folder is used for the XL and Romanian finetuned base model perplexity computing, perplexity results and logistic regression
